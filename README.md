# About
This repository contains multiple implementations

# Building
The recommdned build system is using [uv]{https://docs.astral.sh/uv} with python 3.13:

```console
git clone URL
cd separation-equations
uv venv --python 3.13
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

With this virtual environment installed, the user can then run the .ipynb files in an ide like vscode and specify the interpreter to be used as the local venv.
